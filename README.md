# CS-370-Reflection

Portfolio Reflection

For this project I built an intelligent agent for the pirate simulation using reinforcement learning. The starting notebook gave me the environment setup, the rules of the pirate world, and the basic structure for training and running the agent. It also included the helper functions for state representation and for stepping through the environment. My job was to create the logic that allowed the agent to learn. I wrote the code that handled the Q learning process, updated the Q table values during training, controlled the exploration and exploitation behavior, and adjusted the learning parameters so the agent improved over time. I also wrote the code that evaluated the trained agent so I could see how well it performed. By the end of the project I had a working model that could navigate the environment and make decisions based on its past experiences.

This course tied together concepts that sit at the core of modern computer science. Reinforcement learning and neural network design are used in fields like robotics, automation, gaming, self driving systems, and recommendation engines. A computer scientist takes abstract problems and turns them into something a machine can understand through algorithms, data structures, and modeling. The pirate agent might be simple, but the same ideas scale to real world challenges. Training an agent to learn through trial and error mirrors the same strategies used in industry for optimizing complex systems.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I try to break it down into smaller parts that I can understand and control. In this project that meant understanding the environment first, then deciding what the agent needed to learn, then designing the learning loop step by step. I focus on separating what the system already provides from what I need to build myself. I try to keep experimenting, adjusting values, testing outcomes, and making sense of why something works or fails. That mindset is important because most problems in computer science do not have one perfect path. You have to be willing to explore and learn from the behavior of your programs.

There are also ethical responsibilities tied to this work. Any intelligent system affects real users and organizations that rely on it. A model needs to be fair, safe, and predictable. If it makes decisions, I need to think about how those decisions impact the people interacting with it. I also have a responsibility to build systems that are understandable and maintainable so the organization can trust them. Even in a classroom project like this, it is important to think about how learning systems behave and how to make sure they function responsibly when used in a larger context.
